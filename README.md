# RunMazer

We are using Unity Version 2019.4.11f1 for our Game.

We want to create a roguelike game.
The concept for it is located here: https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kiuhw0A=/

Goal of the game is to escape the maze. For that the player has to trigger four switches and then return to the base and leave the maze by going through the trap door. But be careful, the maze is filled with deadly traps. Luckily, someone before you left food and useful items in the maze, which will help you survive this nightmare.

Controls:
 - W,A,S,D to move around
 - M to maximize the mini map
 - Esc to pause and resume the game
 - Shift to sprint
